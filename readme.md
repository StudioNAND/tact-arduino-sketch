# Tact Arduino Sketches

Arduino sketches to drive Tact sensor – an electronic circuit that enables experiments with capacitive sensing.

This project belongs to the following repositories:

* **[Tact Boards](http://github.com/StudioNAND/tact-hardware)** contains sensor schematics.
* **[Tact Arduino library](https://github.com/philippschmitt/tact-arduino)** by Philipp Schmitt. 
* **[Tact for Processing](http://github.com/StudioNAND/tact-processing)** for retrieving and processing sensor data in an easy manner.

## Installation
To install simply download the [latest release](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tact/arduino-sketches/tact-arduino-sketch.zip) and upload the appropriate sketch to your Arduino.

## Who made this?
All scripts have been developed by [Studio NAND](http://www.nand.io). They are based on many smart ideas – so cheers to everyone who contributed her/his time to investigate capacitive technology! Special thanks to the team around [Ivan Poupyrev](http://www.ivanpoupyrev.com/) for all the research within this field and [Mads Hobye](http://www.hobye.dk/) for his [Arduino tutorial](http://www.instructables.com/id/Touche-for-Arduino-Advanced-touch-sensing/) about advanced touch sensing. All of that has been a big help and inspiration.
